This README.dev file describes the development environment.

The development sources are available through anonymous CVS at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=hello

This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from CVS (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

This distribution also uses Gnulib (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib)
to share common files, with the files being checked in to CVS.  If you
want to update from the current gnulib, do a cvs checkout of gnulib, and
then run
  gnulib-tool --update
in the top-level directory.

For the record, the first time invocation was
  gnulib-tool --import --m4-base=gnulib/m4 --source-base=gnulib/lib \
    getopt gettext
Current gnulib information is recorded in gnulib/m4/gnulib-cache.m4.

After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  sh ./autogen.sh
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.
